Paul Charles Morphy ( June 22 , 1837   – July 10 , 1884 ) was an American chess player . He is considered to have been the greatest chess master of his era and an unofficial World Chess Champion . A chess prodigy , he was called " The Pride and Sorrow of Chess " because he had a brilliant chess career but retired from the game while still young . Bobby Fischer ranked him among the ten greatest players of all time , and described him as " perhaps the most accurate player who ever lived " . Morphy was born in New Orleans to a wealthy and distinguished family . He learned to play chess by simply watching games between his father and uncle . His family soon recognized the boy 's talent and encouraged him to play at family gatherings , and by the age of nine he was considered to be one of the best players in the city . At just twelve years of age , Morphy defeated visiting Hungarian master Johann Löwenthal in a match of three games . After receiving his degree in 1857 , Morphy was not yet of legal age to practice law and found himself with free time . At his uncle 's urging , he accepted an invitation to play at the First American Chess Congress in New York City . After winning the tournament , which included strong players such as Alexander Meek and Louis Paulsen , Morphy was hailed as the chess champion of the United States and stayed in New York playing chess through 1857 , winning the vast majority of his games . In 1858 , Morphy traveled to Europe to play European Champion Howard Staunton . Morphy played almost every strong player in Europe , usually winning easily . The match with Staunton never materialized , but Morphy was acclaimed by most in Europe as the world 's best player . Returning to the United States in triumph , Morphy toured the major cities playing chess on his way back to New Orleans . By 1859 , on returning to New Orleans , Morphy declared he was retiring from chess to begin his law career . However , Morphy was never able to establish a successful law practice and ultimately lived a life of idleness , living off his family 's fortune . Despite appeals from his chess admirers , Morphy never returned to the game , and died in 1884 from a stroke at the age of 47 .
